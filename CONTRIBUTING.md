# Contributing to Security-Patch-Manager

### Found a Bug? üêõ

- **Check if the bug has already been reported** by searching [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Armoghans-Organization/Security-Patch-Manager/issues). If you find an open issue, you can add additional information if needed.
- If the issue hasn't been reported yet, [open a new one](https://github.com/Armoghans-Organization/Security-Patch-Manager/issues/new). Provide a **clear title and description**, along with relevant information such as a **code sample**, **screenshot**, or **test case** demonstrating the problem.
- When creating a new issue, use the provided bug report templates. Avoid generic descriptions like "bug" or "feature" in the title; these will be addressed with labels.

### Have a Patch That Fixes an Issue?

- Excellent! Create a new pull request on GitHub with your fix.
- All development occurs on the `dev` branch, so fork from there when creating a new PR.
- Ensure your PR description clearly explains the problem and solution, and include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- **Before submitting**, review the [coding conventions](#coding-conventions) section below for coding and commit message expectations.

## Coding Conventions

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (soft tabs).
- Utilize the `print_message` function for printing colored text.
- Utilize the `press_enter` function to wait for an Enter key press to continue.
- Avoid code duplication in templates by creating Functions for components.
- Organize code logically for readability.
- Add comments when code intent isn't immediately clear or to break up large logic blocks.
- Reference static text using Global Variables.
- Commit frequently, preferring incremental changes over large commits.

The project includes a Prettier config to format code according to these guidelines.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) in commit messages for context.
- Start with a short summary within the first 72 characters.
- Provide more detailed explanations in paragraphs below the summary, separated by a blank line.
- Use imperative language (e.g., "Fix bug", not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug").
- Avoid ending the summary line with a period.
- Reference fixed issues using their GitHub issue numbers.
