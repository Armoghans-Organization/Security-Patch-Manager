## Overview

Security-Patch-Manager is a Bash script designed to streamline the process of managing system security updates on Linux-based environments. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this script automates the tasks of checking for available updates, displaying relevant information, and applying updates when desired.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the Security Patch Manager script:

- **awk**: A programming language and utility for pattern scanning and processing. It's used in various parts of the script for text processing.

- **column**: A command-line utility to format its input into multiple columns. It's used to format the output of certain commands for better readability.

- **ping**: A command-line utility to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. In the script, it's used to check for an active internet connection.

- **sudo**: A command-line utility that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user. It's used to run certain commands with elevated privileges.

- **apt**: The package management tool for Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu. It's used to update, upgrade, and manage software packages.

Make sure these dependencies are installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come with these utilities pre-installed, but if any of them are missing, you can install them using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install missing dependencies.
